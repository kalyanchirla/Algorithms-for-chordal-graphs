# Algorithms for Chordal Graphs

## Description
***Graphs*** are one of the most used data structures in real-world applications. The speciality of graphs is that they can modelled to represent relationships between things which can be useful to solve different problems. Many real-world problems can be reduced to known graph problems which makes it very important to solve these problems in the most efficient way possible.

*Graphs* are used in social network applications to model relationships between two people, determine the information flow, etc. They are also used in navigation applications to represent roads and stations in form of graphs and finding the shortest path between any two stations. They are also used in the internet connectivity, studying protein interactions, neural networks for deep learning, network packet traffic, quantum field theory and so on.

## Aim

Its application in a variety of fields and technologies makes the *graph* an important data structure to study and solve problems in most optimal way possible for its real-time use. 

Various problems related to graphs are **NP-hard** which makes it very difficult to solve these problems on real-time data which consists of very large data as it takes a lot of time to execute these problems on large data.

The whole idea of this project is to take few problems concerned with graphs which are NP-hard and solving those problems in linear time on a special class of graphs called ***Chordal Graphs***. The problems that are going to be discussed are as follows:
- Recognition of Chordal Graph
- Maximum Clique Problem
- Minimum Vertex Coloring Problem
- Maximum Independent Set Problem
- Minimum Clique Cover Problem
